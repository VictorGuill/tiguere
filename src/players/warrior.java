/*

All of them have their own  inventory where they keep their weapons, magic potions 
and various objects they find or acquire during the adventure. 
They also have a sack of gold coins in order to buy and sell objects as the game allows them to do so.
Each character has a given quantity of HP or Hit Points (when a character loses its hit points, it dies).  
Warriors are the only characters that can carry two weapons at the same time (one in each hand) . 
As they are really strong , they can also carry other objects. 
Warriors have a  special skill that allows  them to improve their weapons thanks to their knowledge of different metals and minerals.
